If you do go, I highly recommend the [Black Dog Bistro](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063494546421) for a bite to eat or a drink (or both!). There's lots of Art Galleries, gift shops, clothing boutiques and restaurants in Bayfield as well. Another place I recommend is [The Hive](https://www.facebook.com/hivebayfield) they sell art, gift items and women's clothing. But it's also a coffee shop (I love their iced teas!) and they do fancy coffee drinks like espressos and lates (with vegan and lactose free options!).",/r/ontario/comments/14ci5my/your_favourite_small_towns/jol8e4u/

Being a mixed-race couple we get some occasional looks here or there just about everywhere from anyone whether it’s Toronto or Timmins , but overall most of the popular towns listed here that we have been to are relatively good. 

I was incredibly impressed by Creemore. For such a small area it has been built up amazingly(thanks Creemore brewing), it’s also close to collingwood/blue mountain which adds for great excursions. 

We also love Muskoka, it’s obviously the traditional and sometimes overplayed answer for this, but there’s a reason.

Randomfinn,"I’ve lived in a bunch of places all over Ontario from dt Toronto to places hours from the nearest gas station. 

For small town, you want small, but you also want services and access to healthcare and shops. Nothing like spending a season nurturing a blueberry bush to harvest enough for one morning’s oatmeal to make you appreciate grocery shops. I echo the post-secondary institution adds vibrancy - university is better than college, but college is better than nothing. 

Also look at who just got elected locally. Has it been the same mayor for decades?  Which councillor got the most votes and what was their platform?

Personally I vote for Brockville, it has TWO witchy stores, cute downtown, an art community, but then a bunch of necessity to life shops off the 401 plus all the fast food joints (sometimes ya got a craving). 

The wilderness is Canadian Shield/Rivers/Lakes. Mostly second growth forest and old farms. There is a bunch of “back to the earth”, off-grid hippies, throuples, etc type people just out of town - and a very accepting queer scene. Definitely marketed itself as an retirement destination - but now they are dying off and younger people are moving in. 

Access to Kingston and Ottawa in an hour for major health stuff (Brockvegas has a level one hospital), Montreal is Two hours away, Toronto is three. It is also on the VIA line for anyone that wants to visit you.

If OP wants cafes and shops in the core (a lively downtown for example), lots of nature nearby, cottages close by (there are tons within an hour north of Kingston), old buildings, I mean...
